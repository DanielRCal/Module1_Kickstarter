# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
    This analysis was created to show how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges
    I performed my analysis by using the collection of data in the [Kickstarter_Challenge]()file.  I began my analysis by narrowing down Categories into Subcategories, converting timestamp dates and times into more easily translatable formats, and creating additional worksheets that extrapolated necessary data from the bigger data worksheets.  I then used formulas within excel to find values of the data that included: means, medians, upper quartiles and standard deviations of the data set.  The last step of this analysis was to use both the original and newly created data set to create a PivotChart to summarize the success or failure of certain plays.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    For this analysis, I organized the given information in Excel to create a PivotChart and then a LineChart.  I orgnazined my the information in my PivotChart to create an x-axis using the "Date Created" category.  The y-axis I arranged using the outcomes column. The "outcomes column" was also used in the Values fields to show how the information related to the x- and y- axis.  My Filters field included both the Parent and Date Ended Columns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    This analysis included the Goals column utilized as the x-axis, the Values column used as the y-axis, and the Values field being comprized of the Sum of Percentages for Successful, Failed, and Canceled plays.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
    I had difficulty organizing the points on my Outcomes based on Goals Chart.  Also, I was unable to change the percentages on my y-axis to show percentages

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the        Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    One conclusion I reached from looking at the Line Chart was that Theater is most successful during the months of April to July.  The other conculsion would be just the opposite of that.  This information tells us that it would not be a wise Idea to begin a kickerstater campaign for a theater production during the fall and winter months.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    Looking at the outcomes based on Goals chart, I can conclude that there was a higher percentage for success in a play had a fundraising goal set between $1-$5,000.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    Some limitations to this dataset are that we have no way to prove that these plays were successful because they were most liked or just because they were funded during peak season.  Another limitation would be the number of backers that supported each production.  

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    We could make a box chart to compare successful plays by country or by years.
